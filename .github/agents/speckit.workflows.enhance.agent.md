<!-- Extension: workflows -->
<!-- Config: .specify/extensions/workflows/ -->
The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

The text the user typed after `/speckit.workflows.enhance` (or `/speckit.enhance`) in the triggering message **is** the enhancement description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `$ARGUMENTS` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that enhancement description, do this:

1. Run the script `.specify/extensions/workflows/scripts/bash/create-enhance.sh` from repo root and parse its JSON output for ENHANCE_ID, BRANCH_NAME, and ENHANCEMENT_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
  **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for.

2. Load `.specify/extensions/workflows/templates/enhance/enhancement-template.md` to understand required sections.

3. Write the enhancement document to ENHANCEMENT_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the enhancement description while preserving section order and headings.
   - Extract what is being enhanced and why from the description
   - Define proposed changes clearly
   - Create a simple, single-phase implementation plan
   - Break down into 3-7 specific tasks (if more needed, suggest using /speckit.specify instead)
   - Define clear acceptance criteria
   - Mark priority based on description (enhancement requests are typically Medium unless specified)

4. Report completion with Next Steps:

```
Enhancement workflow initialized

**Branch**: [BRANCH_NAME]
**Enhancement ID**: [ENHANCE_ID]
**Enhancement Document**: [ENHANCEMENT_FILE]

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the enhancement.md document
2. Verify the implementation plan is appropriate for a minor enhancement
3. Run `/speckit.implement` to execute the enhancement
4. Verify all tests pass and functionality works as expected

**Reminder**:
- If this requires more than 1 phase or >7 tasks, consider using `/speckit.specify` instead
- Enhancement workflow is for quick, minor improvements only
- All changes should still include appropriate tests
```

Note: The script creates and checks out the new branch before writing files.
